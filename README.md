## If you want to build this app

Before you run this app you have to register your app in [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup).

This app relies on Firebase to recieve push notifications that are send by the [DiskInfoAPI](https://github.com/BlueDragon709/DiskInfoAPI).

This app doesn't do anything if you don't have my [DiskInfoAPI](https://github.com/BlueDragon709/DiskInfoAPI) running on your network.
